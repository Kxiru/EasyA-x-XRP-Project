### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. What is your DeFi application about?**

- Our DeFi application allows users to trade stocks and hedge their investments automatically using smart contracts. Users can convert between different currencies and create forward exchange contracts to mitigate currency volatility.

**2. How does the automatic currency conversion work?**

- The automatic currency conversion is facilitated by smart contracts. Users can initiate conversions between different currencies by interacting with specific functions in the contract. The conversion rate is fixed and predetermined within the contract.

**3. What is a forward exchange contract, and how does it help in hedging against currency volatility?**

- A forward exchange contract is a customizable agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of one currency for another at a predetermined future date and exchange rate. It helps in hedging against currency volatility by allowing users to lock in an exchange rate today for a future transaction, thus mitigating the risk of adverse exchange rate movements.

**4. How are stocks traded on your platform?**

- Stocks are traded on our platform through smart contracts that represent ownership of the underlying assets. Users can buy, sell, and trade these digital representations of stocks directly within the platform. Trades are executed instantly and settled on the blockchain.

**5. How are transaction fees handled on your platform?**

- Transaction fees are incurred for executing trades and currency conversions on our platform. These fees are typically deducted automatically from the user's account balance at the time of the transaction. The fee structure is transparent and may vary based on factors such as transaction volume and network congestion.
